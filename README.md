Deploying a Node.js app with Heroku
=======================

These steps assume that you've already created a Heroku account. You also need to install the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)

To ensure that everything is set up correctly, you can type in `heroku` in your terminal and you should see some help text that shows up on the screen.

##Log in with Heroku

```
heroku login
```

This will kick off the process that will create a Heroku SSH key for your machine and register it with Heroku. Make sure you select Y when asked to upload your key to Heroku.
